How often do you find yourself feeling hungry or thirsty but don't know what to make? Or maybe you have some ingredients at home you want to use but cant think of a recipe? The meal ingredient generator allows you to search one ingredient for both food and beverage options, and provides you with recipe recommendations for each. 

#### Instructions

Enter the ingredient you'd like to use in the search bar, then click "search". The matching recipe will appear above the search bar. If no recipe is found, a message will appear suggesting you try a different ingredient.

#### Project Status

This project is ongoing, but progress has temporarily slowed. Our future development goals include:

- Add a randomize recipe feature where the user can search the same ingredient multiple times and get a different result each time 
- Make the previous searches clickable links for easier navigation  
- Displaying the recipe in addition to the title and image for a more complete user experience
